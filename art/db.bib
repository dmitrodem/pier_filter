@article{frei2008,
  abstract = {We propose a generalized -matrix definition that facilitates the conversion between the S-parameter and T-parameter for multiport networks based on the well understood and mathematically simple two-port relations. This approach generalizes all multiport networks into two cases: balanced and unbalanced. Balanced networks have the same number of entrance and exit ports and are symmetric to the two-port network. Unbalanced networks generate a nonsquare T-matrix and do not have the same number of entrance and exit ports. Through careful selection of the T-matrix, this method extends two-port symmetry to multiport networks and provides an engineering implementable relationship between the S-parameter and T-parameter for multiport networks. This symmetry extension allows a practical means to cascade and deembed such networks.},

@phdthesis{ofli2004,
abstract = {Microwave and millimeter-wave filters and diplexers are important components for channel selection and signal separation in many communication systems. Their electrical perfor¬ mances are crucial for the overall system design. Low-insertion loss, high return loss and high slope selectivity are simultaneously required for filters. Moreover, these filters should be compact, low-cost, mass-producible and tuning-free. Among the large variety of possi¬ ble filter structures that potentially satisfy some or all of the above criteria, only few are really suitable for low-cost mass fabrication.},
